abstract="A Software Product Line (SPL) aims to support the development of a family of similar software products from a common set of shared assets. SPLs represent a long-term investment and have a considerable life-span. In order to realize a return-on-investment, companies dealing with SPLs often plan their product portfolios and software engineering activities strategically over many months or years ahead. Compared to single system engineering, SPL evolution exhibits higher complexity due to the variability and the interdependencies between products. This chapter provides an overview on concepts and challenges in SPL evolution and summarizes the state of the art. For this we first describe the general process for SPL evolution and general modeling concepts to specify SPL evolution. On this base, we provide an overview on the state-of-the-art in each of the main process tasks which are migration towards SPLs, analysis of (existing) SPL evolution, planning of future SPL evolution, and implementation of SPL evolution.",

While recent research results have been achieved in the domain of architectures, requirements and user interfaces, very little attention has been devoted to the adaptation of the data manipulation aspects of the system. However, mobile and pervasive applications impose constraints over the amount of data that can be supported, thus making necessary to adapt the schema to the current context in order to provide only relevant data to the system user.",

abstract = "While recent data management technologies, such as object oriented techniques, address the problem of database schema evolution, standard information systems currently in use raise challenging evolution problems. This paper examines database evolution from the developer point of view. It shows how requirements changes are propagated to database schemas, to data and to programs through a general strategy. This strategy requires the documentation of database design. When absent, such documentation has to be rebuilt through reverse engineering techniques. Our approach, called DB-MAIN, relies on a generic database model and on transformational paradigm that states that database engineering processes can be modeled by schema transformations. Indeed, a transformation provides both structural and instance mappings that formally define how to modify database structures and contents. We describe both the complete and a simplified approaches, and compare their merits and drawbacks. We then analyze the problem of program modification and describe a CASE tool that can assist developers in their task of system evolution. We illustrate our approach with Biomaze, a biochemical knowledge-based the database of which is rapidly evolving."

abstract = "In order to follow the evolution of application needs, a database management system is easily expected to undergo changes involving database structure after implementation. Schema evolution concerns the ability of maintaining extant data in response to changes in database structure. Schema versioning enables the use of extensional data through multiple schema interface as created by a history of schema changes. However, schema versioning has been considered only to a limited extent in current literature. Also in the field of temporal databases, whereas a great deal of work has been done concerning temporal versioning of extensional data, a thorough investigation of schema versioning potentialities has not yet been made. In this paper we consider schema versioning in a broader perspective and introduce new design options whose distinct semantic properties and functionalities will be discussed. First of all, we consider solutions for schema versioning along transaction time but also along valid time. Moreover, the support of schema versioning implies operations both at intensional and extensional level. Two distinct design solutions (namely single- and multi-pool) are presented for the management of extensional data in a system supporting schema versioning. Finally, a further distinction is introduced to define synchronous and asynchronous management of versioned data and schemata. The proposed solutions differ in their semantics and in the possible operations they support. The mechanisms for the selection of data through a schema version are in many cases strictly related to the particular schema versioning solution adopted, that also affects the data definition and manipulation language at user-interface level. In particular, we show how the temporal language TSQL2, originally designed to support basic functionalities of transaction-time schema versioning, can accordingly be extended. ©1997 Elsevier Science Ltd"

The implications of allowing data structures to evolve over time within a TODM and related databases are examined in this paper, and key issues and concepts are identified. Specifically, Temporally Oriented Data Definition (TODD) raises questions with respect to (1) the evolution of meanings in databases, (2) the nature of the temporal prevalence of database schema, and (3) the general principles that may guide the implementation of a TODM database with TODD."

In particular, schema versioning, and its weaker companion, schema evolution, deal with the need to retain current data and software system functionality in the face of changing database structure. Schema versioning and schema evolution offer a solution to the problem by enabling intelligent handling of any temporal mismatch between data and data structure. This survey discusses the modelling, architectural and query language issues relating to the support of evolving schemata in database systems. An indication of the future directions of schema versioning research is also given."

This chapter identifies the problem of mapping adaptation in dynamic environments with evolving schemas. To achieve interoperability, modem information systems and e-commerce applications use mappings to translate data from one representation to another. In dynamic environments like the Web, data sources may change not only their data but also their schemas, their semantics, and their query capabilities. Such changes must be reflected in the mappings. The chapter motivates the need for an automated system to adapt mappings and describes several areas in which the solutions can be applied. This chapter presents a novel framework and a tool, Toronto Mapping Adaptation System (ToMAS), that automatically maintains the consistency of the mappings as schemas evolve. The approach is unique in many ways. It considers and manages a very general class of mappings including GLAV mappings. This chapter considers changes not only on the schema structure but also on the schema semantics either in the source or in the target. Further, it supports schema changes that involve multiple schema elements."
