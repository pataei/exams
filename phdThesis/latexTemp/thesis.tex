\abstract{
%In this thesis I present the variational database, a formal framework for representing variation 
%in relational databases, the variational relational algebra, a query language for extracting
%information from the variational database that accounts explicitly for variation in the query
%language.
In this thesis I present the variational database management system, a formal framework and its
implementation for representing variation in relational databases and managing variational
information needs. 
%
The variational database is intended to support any instance of variation in database, both
the existing instances and more importantly newly arisen instances which could be a 
combination of existing instances.
%
For example, existing instances of variation in databases are when a single database evolves
over time and when data from different sources is combined. While there are context-specific 
solutions to both problems neither solution can address when data sources combined in one
database evolves over time. 

%
This thesis collects a large amount of work: 
%
It defines the variational database framework and the syntax and \TODO{specific kind of} 
semantics of the variational relational algebra.
% along with its type system and 
%semantic-preserving syntax-based equivalence rules. 
%
It also defines
the variational information needs that must be satisfied in a generic variational database 
framework and \TODO{shows/proves} that the introduced framework satisfies all these
needs. 
%
It illustrates two usecases of the variational database framework that represent two existing 
instances of variation in databases.
%
It presents the variational database management system which is the implementation of 
the variational database and variational relational algebra and is an abstract layer on top
of a traditional RDBMS. 
%
It also presents several theoretical results related to the framework and query language, such 
as syntax-based equivalence rules that preserve the semantics of a query, 
a type system for ensuring that a variational query is well formed with regards to the 
underlying variational schema, and a confluence property of variational relational
algebra type system and semantics with regards to the relational algebra type system 
and semantics. 
%Variation occurs in databases in many different forms and contexts. For example, a single database schema evolves over time, data from different sources may be combined, and the various configurations of a software product line (SPL) may have different data needs. 
%%
%While approaches have been developed to deal with many such scenarios, particularly in the fields of database evolution and data integration, there is no solution that treats variation as a general and orthogonal concern in databases. This is a problem when various kinds of variation intersect, such as during the evolution of a SPL.
%%
%Databases used in the same context that are intended to satisfy the same information need
%share commonalities while varying in some aspects as well. 
%% 
%For example, databases used to store information for a software system are intended to 
%satisfy the client's information need and they share some parts of the schema, however, 
%they still vary in some parts of the schema and most of the content.
%%
%That is, they are \emph{variants} of a conceptual hypothetical database that captures all 
%the \emph{variation} among them.
%%
%This pattern appears repeatedly in databases. Instances of variation occurring in databases
%are: schema evolution, database integration, database versioning, data extraction, and 
%software development either using software product lines approaches or not. 
%%
%While there are specialized approaches to some instances of variation in databases
%there are no generic solutions to manage variation in databases.
%
%In this thesis, we answer the question: ``can we abstract out this repeating pattern of 
%variation appearing in databases and bring the hypothetical database that captures all
%the variation among a number of databases to life?''
%%
%To this end, we formalize the database that captures all variation of a number of databases,
%called a \emph{variational database}, and a query language that allows interaction with
%the said database, called \emph{variational relational algebra}. 
%\TODO{maybe two languages, another: variational SQL, depends on my timing!}
%%
%We implement these concepts in \emph{Variational Database Management System (VDBMS)},
%demonstrate the feasibility of our concepts by developing two real-world use cases, and 
%examine the performance of VDBMS over our two use cases.
