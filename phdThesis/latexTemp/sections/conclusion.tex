\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

This thesis has presented the variational database framework as a generic
solution to encoding multiple variants of a database collectively in one place for any 
kind of variation appearing in databases. The VDB framework is intended to
systematically ensure that the variation in data and queries are encoded
correctly and consistently. Thus, removing the burden of manual workarounds
from database administrators and developers. If successful, it can improve 
the state of variation in databases research by providing
a configurable database system for any kind of variation in databases. Thus,
instead of developing a new database system each time a new kind of 
variation in databases arises, one can adjust and configure VDBMS
to their need.
