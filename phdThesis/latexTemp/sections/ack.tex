First and foremost, thank you to my advisor Eric Walkingshaw, who had a significant
role in forming the researcher and the person I am today. 
I am forever grateful for your unconditional support
(both personally and professionally), guidance, enthusiasm, and encouragement. 
%Thank you for believing in me even at the

A very special thank you to my partner Jeffrey Young for his love, support, and 
encouragement. Thank you for helping me learn Haskell, discussing research ideas and problems,
practicing many presentations, and studying various books and papers with me. 
Thank you for your support through emotionally tough moments, from dealing with racist policies
to depression from a pandemic and a harsh immigration process. 
I am proud of us for finishing our PhDs together during a pandemic, OSU's lack of support of our group, and immigration process. 
Thank you for an amazing graduation gift. I cannot wait to get fit again and drop the PhD weight! 
%And congratulation for graduating your PhD! 
%I appreciate our graduate school years, for getting through it together during a pandemic and dealing with consequences of university's lack of support for the PL group due to partly 
%not  understanding the importance of the field. 
Thank you for sharing your life with me.
I look forward to our life together, out of the brutality of graduate school. It is only uphill from here on out. 


Thank you to the many OSU faculty members during my time here. 
Special thank you to Glencora Borradaile for her unwavering support 
of graduate students and Martin Erwig for many constructive advice on 
Programming Languages research.
Thank you to the members of my program committee--Martin Erwig, 
Alan Fern, Amir Nayyeri--for all their support and advice.

%
Thank you Nasim 
and Ali Mohtat for your many wise words and kind support--from

I am very grateful to my advisor Emmanuel Cand`es for piquing my interest in applied
math and statistics through his papers as an undergrad and later on throughout my
Ph.D. at Stanford. Emmanuel?s insistence on tackling difficult yet relevant problems
was ideal for me. His advice and feedback on research and scientific writing-even when
I disagreed with them-were invaluable as it would often force me into the thinking
position. I am also thankful to him for giving me the freedom to pursue eclectic and
sometimes unorthodox research directions which helped me find an independent voice
in research. Finally, Emmanuel?s dedication to making theoretical research accessible
to and understandable by a wide audience through meticulous editing of papers,
presentations and class lectures has been nothing short of exemplary for me.
I would like to express my gratitude to Stephen Boyd, Trevor Hastie, Andrea
Montanari, and David Tse for serving on my thesis committee, as well as many other
professors whom I took classes with at Stanford. I would like to thank Andrea Montanari for many enthusiastic presentations, lectures and classes at Stanford. His depth
and diversity of knowledge made his research presentations/classes a very enriching
and rewarding experience. I am grateful to Trevor Hastie for teaching me statistical
learning through his classes and his fantastic book as well as his support during the
past year. I would also like to thank Stephen Boyd for giving me the opportunity to
teach his class during my second year as a grad student which helped me get a better
grasp of convex optimization early on.
I have been fortunate to have had great peers throughout my education. Countless
peers and friends during undergrad at Sharif EE who with their uniform excellence
kept me motivated and focused on my studies. Special thanks goes to Saber Saleh
Kaleybar and Adel Javanmard my collaborators through many course assignments
and projects. I would also like to thank several fellow graduate students as well as my
group members past and present at Stanford: Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Xiaodong
Li, Adel Javanmard, Yaniv Plan, Mark Davenport, Ewout Van Den Berg, Stephen
Becker, Rina Foygel, Lester Mackey, Veniamin Morgenshtern, Deanna Needell, Reinhard Heckel, Carlos Sing-Long, Vlad Voroninski, Alexandra Chouldechova, Weijie Su,
Kahye Song, Yuxin Chen, and Kenji Nakahira.
Last but not least, I am eternally grateful to my parents and my sister, for their
endless love and support. Without you, I would not be here today.
