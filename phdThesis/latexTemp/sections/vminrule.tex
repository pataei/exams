VRA is flexible since an information need can be represented via multiple
v-queries as demonstrated in \exref{vq-specific} and \exref{vq-same-intent-mult-vars}.
It allows users to incorporate their personal taste and task requirements
into v-queries they write by 
having different levels of variation. For example, consider the explicitly annotated query
\ensuremath{\vQ_5} 
in \secref{constrain}:\\
\ensuremath {
\vQ_5 =
\pi_{\optAtt [\vFour \vee \vFive] [\empno], \optAtt [\vFour] [\name], \optAtt [\vFive] [\fname], \optAtt [\vFive] [\lname]  } \left( \chc [\fModel_2] {\empbio, \empRel}\right)}.
%\vQ_5 =  \pi_{\optAtt [\vFour \vee \vFive] [\empno], \optAtt [\vFour] [\name], \optAtt [\vFive] [\fname], \optAtt [\vFive] [\lname]  } \empbio}.
%from \exref{vq-specific}. 
To be explicit about the exact query that will be run for 
each variant 
%and knowing that 
%\ensuremath{
%\getPC \empbio = \vThree \vee \vFour \vee \vFive
%},
the query $\vQ_5$'s variation can be \emph{lifted up} by using choices, resulting in the query $\VVal \vQ_5$\\
\ensuremath{
\small
\VVal \vQ_5 = \chc [\vFour] {\pi_{\empno, \name} \empbio, 
\chc [\vFive] {\pi_{\empno, \fname, \lname} \empbio, \emp}} 
}.
While \ensuremath{\vQ_5} contains less redundancy \ensuremath{\VVal \vQ_5}
is more comprehensible since the variants are explicitly stated in the dimension of the choice. 
Thus, \emph{supporting multiple levels of variation 
creates a tension between reducing redundancy and maintaining comprehensibility.}

We define \emph{variation minimization} rules in \figref{var-min} that are syntactic and 
preserve the semantics.
% and include 
%interesting ones in \secref{var-min}.
Pushing in variation into a query, i.e., applying rules left-to-right, 
reduces redundancy
% and improves performance
while lifting them up, i.e., applying rules right-to-left, 
makes a query more understandable. 
When applied left-to-right, the rules are terminating since the scope of variation 
%always gets smaller.
monotonically decreases in size.

%Additionally, these rules can be used to simplify queries after
%explicitly annotating them with a schema. For example, the first rule in \figref{var-min}
%is used to simplify the query \ensuremath{\constrain [\vSch_2] {\vQ_1}}, introduced in \secref{var-pres},
% which resulted
%in \ensuremath{\vQ_6}.}
