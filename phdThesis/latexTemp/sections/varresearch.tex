\section{Variational Research}
\label{sec:varresearch}

The representation of variational schemas and variational tables is based on previous
work on variational sets~\cite{EWC13fosd}, which is part of a larger effort
toward developing safe and efficient variational data
structures~\cite{Walk14onward,MMWWK17vamos}. The central motivation of work on
variational data structures is that many applications can benefit from
maintaining and computing with variation at
runtime~\cite{EW11gttse,CEW16ecoop}. Implementing SPL analyses
are an example of such an application, but there are many
more~\cite{Walk14onward}.The ability to maintain and query several
variants of a database at once extends the idea of computing with variation to
relational databases.
