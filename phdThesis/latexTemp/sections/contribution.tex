\section{Contributions and Outline of this Thesis}
\label{sec:contribution}

\TODO{to be filled out when I have the chapters.}

The high level goal of this thesis is to emphasize the need for a variation-aware database
framework and to present one such framework. Therefore, in addition to the formal 
definition of the framework and query language, it also provides variational data sets 
(including both the variational database and a set of queries) to illustrate the feasibility
of the proposed framework. Furthermore, it illustrates various approaches to implement
such a framework and compares their performance.

The rest of this section describes the structure of this thesis, enumerating the specific 
contribution that each chapter makes. 

\chref{bg} (\emph{Background}) introduces several concepts and terms that are the 
basis of this thesis. It describes types and how to interpret them. It explains relational
databases with assumptions that are held throughout the thesis and relational algebra. 
It also describes various ways of incorporating variation
into elements of a database.

\TODO{\chref{vql}}

\chref{vdbusecase} aims at guiding an expert through generating a VDB and writing
variational queries for a variation scenario where unfortunately the database variants
do not exist and thus, generating the VDB requires the expert knowledge and cannot
be automated. 
%
It details two such variation scenario and introduces two use cases of VDB, one over space
(adopts the email SPL described by \citet{Hall05} and explained in \secref{enron-vdb})
 and another over time (adopts the evolution 
of an employee schema described by \citet{prima08Moon} and explained in \secref{emp-vdb}), 
in addition to how a VDB can store all database variants in a single database and
 how variational queries can capture various information needs over different database variants
in a single query. It also describes how  the VDBs were systematically 
generated and how the variational queries
were adapted and adjusted from papers describing the variation scenario. 
%
The last section of this chapter, \secref{usecase-disc}, discusses the question 
``should variation be encoded explicitly in databases?'' through the lessons learned 
while generating these use cases.

\chref{rw} (\emph{Related Work}) collects research related to different kinds of variation 
in databases and other related variational research.
