A variational schema captures variation in the structure of a database by indicating which attributes and relations are included or excluded in which variants.
%
%\point{using annotated elements to show variability in schema.}
%Variation can exist in the structure of data, i.e., the schema.
%As motivated in \secref{mot}, schema variations include/exclude relations/attributes. 
To this end, we annotate attributes, relations, and the schema itself with
feature expressions,
which describe the conditions under which each is present.
%
A \emph{\vrelTxt\ schema} (\emph{v-relation schema}), \vRelSch, is a relation name
with an annotated variational set of attributes,
%\centerline{
$\synDef {\vRelSch} \vRelSchSet \eqq \vRelDef$,
%}
where \ensuremath{\vAttList \in \vAttSet} is a variational attribute set.
The presence condition of the v-relation schema, \dimMeta, determines in what
variants of the database the relation itself is present in.
%A \emph{variational attribute set}, \vAttList, is a variational set of attributes.
%%i.e.,
%%$\synDef \vAttList \vAttSet \eqq \optAtt, \vAttList \myOR \empAtt$,
%%where \empAtt\ denotes an empty attribute. 
%%\exref{vsch} illustrates creating
%%a v-schema.
%
A \emph{\vschTxt} (\emph{v-schema}) is an annotated set of v-relation 
schemas,
%\centerline{ 
$\synDef \vSch \vSchSet \eqq \vSchDef$.
%} 
The presence condition of the entire v-schema, \fModel, is the VDB's feature
model, which provides a top-level constraint on the set of valid
configurations, as described in \secref{encode-var}.
%We call such configurations
%\emph{valid} configurations. The v-schema's presence condition 
%is the VDB feature model since it captures the relationship
%between features of the underlying application and their constraints,
%as explained in \secref{encode-var} and introduced as the VDB feature model. 
Hence, the v-schema defines all valid schema variants of a VDB. 


\begin{example}
\label{eg:vsch}
$\vSch_1$ is the v-schema of a VDB that only includes relations \empacct\ and \ecourse\ in the last two rows
of \tabref{mot} and has the
feature space 
\ensuremath{\fSet = \setDef{ \vFour, \vFive, \edu, \tFour, \tFive}}.
Note that attributes that exist conditionally are annotated with a feature expression
to account for such a condition, e.g., the \salary\ attribute only exists when \vFive\ = \t.
%
\begin{align*}
\vSch_1 &=
\{ \empacct ( \empno, \hiredate, \titleatt, \deptno, \annot [\vFive] \salary, \\
&\hspace{55pt} \annot [\edu] \isstudent,
\annot [\edu] \isteacher )^{\vFour \vee \vFive},\\
%
&\hspace{17pt} \ecourse ( \cno, \cname, \annot [\tFive] \deptno )^{\tFour \vee \tFive} \}^{\fModel_1}\\
\fModel_1 &= (\vFour\oplus\vFive) \wedge
  ((\edu\wedge(\tFour\oplus\tFive)) \vee (\neg\edu\wedge\neg(\tFour\vee\tFive)))
\end{align*}
where \ensuremath{\fModel_1} allows only one temporal feature for the basic
schema to be enabled at a time, and either one temporal feature for the education
extension, if \edu\ is enabled, or else no temporal feature for the education
extension.
\end{example}

\NOTE{Double-check my simplification of $\fModel_1$.}

%\textbf{Hierarchal structure of feature expressions in a v-schema:}
The presence of an attribute follows the hierarchal layout of information in a database:
an attribute's presence depends on the presence of its parent v-relation, which in turn 
depends on the presence of the v-schema. 
%relation presence condition and the feature model.
% presence of the v-schema. 
%
Thus, the complete presence condition of the attribute
$\annot[\dimMeta_\vAtt]{\vAtt}$ in v-relation
$\vRel\annot[\dimMeta_\vRel]{(\ldots)}$ defined in v-schema \vSch\ with feature
model \fModel\ is
$\getPCfrom{\vAtt}{\vSch}=\dimMeta_\vAtt\wedge\dimMeta_\vRel\wedge\fModel$.

%and it is present iff this presence condition is satisfiable, i.e., 
%\ensuremath{\sat {\getPCfrom \vAtt \vSch}}.
Similarly, the presence condition of v-relation $\vRel$ is
\ensuremath{\getPCfrom \vRel \vSch = \dimMeta_\vRel \wedge \fModel}.
For example, in \exref{vsch} we have
\ensuremath{\getPCfrom \empacct {\vSch_1} = (\vFour \vee \vFive) \wedge \fModel_1}.

%%presence condition 
%with its v-relation's \revised{annotation}
%%presence condition

%
%Similarly,
%the presence condition of a v-relation is the conjunction of its
%\revised{annotation}
%%presence condition 
%and the feature model.
%%
%\revised{
%In other words, the annotated attribute \optAtt\ of v-relation 
%\ensuremath{\vRel \annot [\dimMeta_\vRel] {\left(\annot \vAtt, \ldots\right)}} 
%%with 
%%$\dimMeta_r = \getPC \vRel$
%defined in the v-schema \vSch\ with feature model \fModel\
%is valid if: $\sat {\getPCfrom \vAtt \vSch} = \sat {\dimMeta_\vAtt \wedge \dimMeta_r \wedge \fModel }$.}
Furthermore, a database element is only present in variants for
which its presence condition satisfiable, e.g., in \exref{vsch}
 the \isstudent\ attribute 
%described in \exref{vsch} 
%is present in the variants that make its presence condition 
%\ensuremath {\edu \wedge (\vFour \vee \vFive) \wedge \fModel_1 }
%satisfiable.
%So \isstudent\ 
is present in the variant 
\ensuremath{\setDef {\edu, \vFour, \tFive}} since 
\ensuremath{\fSem [\setDef {\edu, \vFour, \tFive}] {\getPCfrom \isstudent {\vSch_1}}
= \fSem [\setDef {\edu, \vFour, \tFive}] {\edu \wedge (\vFour \vee \vFive) \wedge \fModel_1}
= \t \wedge (\t \vee \f) \wedge ((\neg \t \wedge (\t \oplus \f)) \vee (\t \wedge (\t \oplus \f) \wedge (\f \oplus \t))) = \t}
but it is not present in the variant
\ensuremath{\setDef{\vFour, \tFive}} since in this variant \edu = \f, thus,
\ensuremath{\fSem [\setDef {\edu, \vFour, \tFive}] {\getPCfrom \isstudent {\vSch_1}} = \f}.

\NOTE{Revise the above to be consistent with the new $m_1$.}

%\subsubsection{Configuring a V-Schema}
%\label{sec:conf-vsch}
Intuitively and similar to v-sets, a v-schema is a systematic  
compact representation of a set of plain schemas called variants.
%, e.g., SPL, that encodes 
%the variation effectively inside the database schema by means of 
%feature expressions.
%Consequently, v-schemas relieve the
%need to define an intermediate schema and state mappings 
%between it and source schemas, like the approach that 
%data integration systems employ. 
%One can still obtain the 
A schema variant can be obtained 
%A specific pure relational schema for
%a database variant can be obtained 
by \emph{configuring} the v-schema with that variant's configuration.
We define the configuration function for v-schemas and its elements in \figref{vdb-conf} in \appref{vdb-conf}.
%For example, consider the v-schema in \exref{vsch}.
%Configuring the variational attribute set of the \empacct\ v-relation for 
%the variant \setDef {\vFive}, i.e., 
%\ensuremath {\olSem [\setDef {\vFive}] {\empno, \hiredate, \titleatt, \deptno, \annot [\vFive] \salary,
%\annot [\edu] \isstudent,
%\annot [\edu] \isteacher}},
%yields the

%attribute set of
