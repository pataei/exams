\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:bg}

The core of this thesis is injecting a new aspect to relational databases: \emph{variation}.
Thus, the goals of this chapter are twofold: 
%
first, to introduce how variation is encoded and represented in our variational database framework;
%
second, to provide the reader with the concepts and notations
used to build up the main contributions of this thesis, mainly relational databases and
relational algebra.
%
%third, to familiarize the reader with
%main notations and design decision of the thesis. 

%\secref{types} describes types. Types provide readers with a strong tool to understand 
%some formalizations easier and more intuitively.
%
\secref{rdb} describes the database model of relational databases and the specification of
the structured used to store the data. \secref{ra} describes SPJC relational algebra to query
relational databases. 
%
Then, 
\secref{varspace} defines our choice of encoding for the variation space used in the 
variational database as propositional formulas of boolean variables.
%
Finally, we introduce main approaches used to incorporate variation into our variational 
database framework.
\secref{vset} introduces variation into sets which forms the basis of the variational database
framework and \secref{fcc} describes the formula choice calculus used to incorporate 
variation into relational algebra.
