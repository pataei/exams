The core of this thesis is injecting a new aspect to relational databases: \emph{variation}.
Thus, the goals of this chapter are twofold: 
%
first, to introduce how variation is encoded and represented in our variational database framework;
%
second, to provide the reader with the concepts and notations
used to build up the main contributions of this thesis, mainly relational databases and
relational algebra
%
and approaches used to add variation to them.
% of converting non-variational components into
%variational counterparts by using the introduced encoding of variation. 
%third, to familiarize the reader with
%main notations and design decision of the thesis. 

%
Throughout the thesis, we discuss relational concepts and their
variational counterparts. 
For clarity or when it is unclear from context, we use
an $\underline{underline}$ to distinguish a non-variational entity
from its variational counterpart,
%when we need to emphasize 
%an entity is not variational we underline it, 
e.g., \pElem\ is a 
non-variational entity while \elem\ is its variational counterpart,
if it exists.
%
Additionally, throughout the thesis, we rely on types to give an intuition to the reader for
understanding concepts. A type is a set of possible values. For example, the type ``$\mathit{Int}$''
denotes all possible integers. In our formalization, we use the notation of $i \in \mathit{Int}$ to
state that the variable $i$ is of type $\mathit{Int}$. However, for brevity, we usually use 
bold capital letters for types, for example, instead of $\mathit{Int}$ we write $\mathcal{I}$ to denote the type $\mathit{Int}$.
%
When needed, we extend a type with a non-existing element $\bot$ and to account for this
extension at the type level we subscript the type with $\bot$. For example, $\maybe {\mathcal{I}}$
denotes the extension of the type $\mathcal{I}$ with a non-existing element.


%\secref{types} describes types. Types provide readers with a strong tool to understand 
%some formalizations easier and more intuitively.
%
\secref{rdb} describes the database model of relational databases and the specification of
the structured used to store the data~\cite{AliceBook}. 
\secref{ra} describes the relational algebra to query relational databases~\cite{AliceBook}.
%
Then, 
\secref{varspace} defines our choice of encoding for the variation space used in the 
variational database as propositional formulas of boolean variables~\cite{ATW18poly,ATW17dbpl}.
%
Finally, we introduce main techniques used to incorporate variation into our variational 
database framework.
\secref{vset} introduces variation into sets which forms the basis of the variational database
framework~\cite{EWC13fosd,Walk14onward,ATW17dbpl} 
and \secref{fcc} describes the formula choice calculus used to incorporate 
variation into relational algebra~\cite{HW16fosd}.
