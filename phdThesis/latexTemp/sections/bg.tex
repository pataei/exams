\wrrite{add types and nothing added to a type.}
The core of this thesis is injecting a new aspect to relational databases: \emph{variation}.
Thus, the goals of this chapter are twofold: 
%
first, to introduce how variation is encoded and represented in our variational database framework;
%
second, to provide the reader with the concepts and notations
used to build up the main contributions of this thesis, mainly relational databases and
relational algebra.
%
And additionally, developed approaches of converting non-variational components into
variational counterparts by using the introduced encoding of variation. 
%third, to familiarize the reader with
%main notations and design decision of the thesis. 
%
Throughout the thesis, we discuss relational concepts and their
variational counterparts. 
For clarity or when it is unclear from context, we use
an $\underline{underline}$ to distinguish a non-variational entity
from its variational counterpart,
%when we need to emphasize 
%an entity is not variational we underline it, 
e.g., \pElem\ is a 
non-variational entity while \elem\ is its variational counterpart,
if it exists.
\wrrite{types!!}
%\secref{types} describes types. Types provide readers with a strong tool to understand 
%some formalizations easier and more intuitively.
%
\secref{rdb} describes the database model of relational databases and the specification of
the structured used to store the data~\cite{AliceBook}. 
\secref{ra} describes the relational algebra to query relational databases~\cite{AliceBook}.
%
Then, 
\secref{varspace} defines our choice of encoding for the variation space used in the 
variational database as propositional formulas of boolean variables~\cite{ATW18poly,ATW17dbpl}.
%
Finally, we introduce main techniques used to incorporate variation into our variational 
database framework.
\secref{vset} introduces variation into sets which forms the basis of the variational database
framework~\cite{EWC13fosd,Walk14onward,ATW17dbpl} 
and \secref{fcc} describes the formula choice calculus used to incorporate 
variation into relational algebra~\cite{HW16fosd}.
