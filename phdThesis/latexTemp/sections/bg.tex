\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:bg}


The core of this thesis is injecting a new aspect to relational databases: \emph{variation}.
Thus, the goals of this chapter are twofold: 
%
first, to introduce how variation is encoded and represented in our variational database framework;
%
second, to provide the reader with the concepts and notations
used to build up the main contributions of this thesis, mainly relational databases and
relational algebra
%
and approaches used to add variation to them.
% of converting non-variational components into
%variational counterparts by using the introduced encoding of variation. 
%third, to familiarize the reader with
%main notations and design decision of the thesis. 

%
Throughout the thesis, we use types when defining concepts. 
A type is a set of possible values. For example, the type $\mathbf{Int}$
denotes all possible integers. In our formalization, we use the notation of $i \in \mathbf{Int}$ to
state that the variable $i$ is of type $\mathbf{Int}$. 
%
Types can be more general. Consider the type \settype \typevar\ that indicates the set all sets
 of values of type \typevar. Here, \typevar\ is type variable and stands for any possible type. 
Note that concrete types start with a capital letters but type variables do not.
For example, the type $\settype {\mathit{Int}}$ is the type of
sets of integers and it has values such as $\setDef {1,3,4}$ and $\setDef {\ }$.
We also use type synonyms for simplicity. For example, instead of referring to
$\settype {\mathit{Int}}$ we can give it a new name ($\mathit{Setint}= \settype {\mathit{Int}}$) 
and refer to it with the new name $\mathit{Setint}$.
\wrrite{define pair and function types}
%However, for brevity, we usually use 
%bold capital letters for types, for example, instead of $\mathit{Int}$ we write $\mathcal{I}$ to denote the type $\mathit{Int}$.
%
Sometimes we must extend a type with an additional ``bottom'' element $\bot$ and to account for this
extension at the type level we subscript the type with $\bot$. For example, $\maybe {\mathcal{I}}$
denotes the extension of the type $\mathcal{I}$ with $\bot$.
%

%
Throughout the thesis, we discuss relational concepts and their
variational counterparts. 
For clarity or when it is unclear from context, we use
an $\underline{underline}$ to distinguish a non-variational entity
from its variational counterpart, 
both at the value level and the type level,
%when we need to emphasize 
%an entity is not variational we underline it, 
e.g., \pElem\ is a 
non-variational entity while \elem\ is its variational counterpart,
if it exists.


%\secref{types} describes types. Types provide readers with a strong tool to understand 
%some formalizations easier and more intuitively.
%
\secref{rdb} describes the database model of relational databases and 
\eric{that is the schema}
the specification of
the structured used to store the data~\cite{AliceBook}. 
\secref{ra} describes the relational algebra, a query language used to query relational databases~\cite{AliceBook}.
%
\secref{encode-var} defines our encoding of the variation space used in 
variational database and how we describe parts of that space using propositional formulas of boolean variables~\cite{ATW18poly,ATW17dbpl}.
%
Finally, we introduce the main techniques used to incorporate variation into our variational 
database framework.
\secref{vset} introduces variation into sets which forms the basis of the variational database
framework~\cite{EWC13fosd,Walk14onward,ATW17dbpl} 
and \secref{fcc} describes the formula choice calculus used to incorporate 
variation into relational algebra~\cite{HW16fosd}.
