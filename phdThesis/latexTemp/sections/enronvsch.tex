To produce a v-schema for the email VDB, we start from plain schema
of the Enron email dataset shown in \tabref{enron}, then systematically adjust
its schema to align with the information needs of the email SPL described by
\cite{Hall05}. \TODO{fix citet}
%
The \employees\ table contains information about the employees of the company.
%including the employee identification number (\eid), their first name and last
%name (\fname\ and \lname), their primary email address (\emailid), alternative
%email addresses (e.g.\ $\mathit{email2}$), a path to the folder that contains
%their data (\folder), and their last status in the company (\status).
%
The \messages\ table contains information about the email messages.
% including
%the message ID (\midatt), the sender of the message (\sender), the date
%(\dateatt), the internal message ID (\messageid), the subject and body of the
%message (\subject\ and \body), and the exact folder of the email (\folder).
% 
The \recipientinfo\ table contains information about the recipient of a message.
%including the recipient ID (\rid), the message ID (\midatt), the type of the
%message (\rtype), and the email address of the recipient (\rvalue).
%
The \referenceinfo\ table contains messages that have been referenced in other
email messages.
%, for example, in a forwarded message; it contains a
%reference-info ID (\rid), the message ID (\midatt), and the entire message
%(\reference). 
This table simply backs up the emails.

From this starting point, we introduce new attributes and relations that are
needed to implement the features in the email SPL. We attach presence
conditions to new attributes and relations corresponding to the features
they are needed to support, which ensure they will \emph{not} be present
in configurations that do not include the relevant features.
%
The resulting v-schema is given in \tabref{enron-vsch}.


%As an example of this process, 
For example, consider the \signature\ feature. In the
software, implementing this feature requires new operations for signing an
email before sending it out and for verifying the signature of a received
email. These new operations suggest new information needs: we need a way to
indicate that a message has been signed, and we need access to each user's
public key to verify those signatures (private keys used to sign a message
would not be stored in the database). These  needs are reflected in
the v-schema by the new attributes \verificationkey\ and \issigned,
added to the relations \employees\ and \messages, respectively. The new
attributes are annotated by the \signature\ presence condition, indicating that
they correspond to the \signature\ feature and are unused in configurations
that exclude this feature.
%
Additionally, several features require adding entirely new relations, e.g.,
%
%For example, 
when the \forwardmsg\ feature is enabled, the system must keep
track of which users have forwarding enabled and the address to forward the messages to.
%should be forwarded to. 
This need is reflected by the new
\forwardmsg\ relation, which is correspondingly annotated by the \forwardmsg\
presence condition.


A main focus of Hall's decomposition~\cite{Hall05} is on the many feature
interactions.
% in the email SPL. 
Several of the features may interact in
undesirable ways if special precautions are not taken. For example, any
combination of the \forwardmsg, \remailmsg, and \autoresponder\ features can
trigger an infinite messaging loop if users configure the features in the wrong
way; preventing this creates an information need to identify auto-generated
emails, which is realized in the variational schema by attributes like
\isforwardmsg\ and \isautoresponse.
%
% occurs between the \signature\ and \fremailmsg\ features: the \fremailmsg\
% feature enables anonymously sending messages by replacing the sender with a
% pseudonym, but this prevents the recipient from being able to verify a signed
% email.
%
% occurs between the \signature\ and \forwardmsg\ features: if Sarah signs a
% message and sends it to Ina, and Ina forwards the message to Philippe, then
% the signature verification operation may incorrectly interpret Ina as the
% sender rather than Sarah and fail to verify the message.

%p: moved the following paragraph to discussion.
%For each feature, we (1) enumerated the operations that must be supported both
%to implement the feature itself and to resolve undesirable feature
%interactions, (2) identified the information needs to implement these
%operations, and (3) extended the variational schema to satisfy these
%information needs.
%
% The changes made to accommodate the features \addressbook, \encryption,
% \autoresponder, \remailmessage, \filtermessages, and \mailhost\ are similar.

For brevity, we omit some attributes and relations from the original schema
that are irrelevant to the email SPL described by Hall.

%We distribute the variational schema for the email VDB in two formats.
%%
%First, we provide the schema in the encoding used by our prototype VDBMS tool.%
%\footnote{\href{https://github.com/lambda-land/VDBMS/blob/master/usecases/space-emailSPL/schema/EnronSchema.hs}{usecases/space-emailSPL/schema}}
%
%Second, 
We provide the v-schema both in the encoding used by our VDBMS tool and also
in plain SQL.
%The SQL encoding 
% that generates the
% \eric{Eric, I don't like universal here! it may give the wrong idea!
% maybe just say v-schema?}
% universal schema for the VDB.
% in either MySQL or Postgres.%
%\footnote{\href{https://github.com/lambda-land/VDBMS/tree/master/usecases/space-emailSPL/database/create}{usecases/space-emailSPL/database/create}}
%
The SQL encoding is given by a ``universal'' schema containing the relations and
attributes of all variants, plus a relation
\vdbpc\ that captures all of the relevant presence conditions.
% : that of the v-schema itself (i.e.\ the feature model), and those of each
% relation and attribute.
%\footnote{\href{https://github.com/lambda-land/VDBMS/tree/master/usecases/space-emailSPL/database/withSchema}{usecases/space-emailSPL/database/withSchema}}
%
% The $\mathit{element\_id}$ of the feature model is
% $\mathit{variational\_schema}$; the $\mathit{element\_id}$ of a relation \vRel\
% is its name \vRel, and of attribute \vAtt\ in relation \vRel\ is $\vRel.\vAtt$.
%
The plain SQL encoding of the v-schema supports the use
of the use cases for research on the effective management of variation in
databases independent of VDBMS.

%model of the variational schema, a relation \tablespc\ that stores the presence
%condition of each relation, and for each table $R\left(a_1, \cdots, a_n\right)$
%in the variational schema there is a table $t\left(\mathit{attribute\_name},
%\mathit{pres\_cond}\right)$ in the database that stores its attributes'
