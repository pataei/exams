%\TODO{vra semantics. we understand it through RA sem + accumulation}

We use the semantics of relational queries to define the semantics of 
variational queries. In \secref{vraconf}, we define the configuration function
for variational queries which takes a configuration and a variational query
and returns a relational query. We also define another version of the
variational query configuration function that generates unique relational
query variants. Then, in \secref{accum}, we define an accumulation function that accumulates
multiple (annotated) relational tables into a variational table. Finally, in \secref{vradensem}, we  
define the denotational semantics of VRA using the defined configuration and
accumulation functions.
