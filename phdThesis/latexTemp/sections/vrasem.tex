%\TODO{vra semantics. we understand it through RA sem + accumulation}

\eric{pls read the following paragraph}
We use the semantics of relational queries to define the semantics of 
variational queries. To this end we first define the configuration function
for variational queries which takes a configuration and a variational query
and returns a relational query. We also define another version of the
variational query configuration function that generates unique relational
queries. Then, we define an accumulation function that accumulates
multiple relational tables into a variational table.
