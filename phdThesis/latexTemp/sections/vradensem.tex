\subsection{VRA Denotational Semantics }
\label{sec:vradensem}

\eric{pls read this entire section. thx!}
Now that we have all required parts we define the denotational semantics of 
variational relational algebra using the denotational semantics of relational 
algebra. The denotational semantics of relational queries 
$\mathit{rqSem} : \pQSet \totype \pInstSet \totype \pTabSet$ takes a plain query and
a plain database and returns a table named $\mathit{result}$. We do not give a formal 
definition of $\mathit{rqSem}$, however, examples of the semantics
of a query are given in \tabref{vq-conf-res}.
%
We then define the VRA denotational semantics 
$\mathit{vqSem} : \qSet \totype \vdbInstSet \totype \tabletype$ as the 
accumulation of relational tables resulted from the semantics of its
configured queries over their corresponding configured databases for all 
valid configurations of a variational database. 
%
The $\mathit{mapRQSem}$ takes a set of relational queries with their attached
configurations and a variational database instance and returns the set of query 
semantics over their configured database
with their attached configurations, that is, it maps $\mathit{rqSem}$ on the 
relational queries over their corresponding relational database.%
\footnote{In implementation, the closed set of features and valid configurations
of a VDB are contained within, instead of extracting them from the database. However,
we keep the formalization simple and assume that they can also be retrieved from
the VDB.}
