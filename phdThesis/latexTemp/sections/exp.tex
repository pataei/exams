%what are the approaches.
%what machine we used and version of postgres. 
%future work compare different db engines. 

In this section, we compare the performance of VDBMS with regards
to the approaches used to generate SQL query(ies) introduced in \secref{apps}.
For our experiments, approaches introduced in \secref{apps} do not filter out 
tuples with unsatisfiable presence condition unless specifically mentioned otherwise.
Accounting for filtering such tuples explicitly is indicated by adding \emph{(f)} to
the approach name. For example, \nbff\ is the Naive Brute Force approach that 
filters out tuples with unsatisfiable presence conditions. 
%
The variational queries used for our experiments are available online
%
\footnote{All queries are available at: \url{https://zenodo.org/record/4321921}.}
% in \appref{queries}
and they are described in \chref{vdbusecase}.
%
The runtime of queries contains all elements of an approach including the query
passing the type system, being explicitly annotated by the variational schema, 
being optimized by the variation minimization rules, passed to the SQL generator, 
run on the VDB, and finally, the final variational table is generated. 
%
We run the experiments on a MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz Core i7 processor and 
8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3. All experiments are also run with the PostgreSQL 13.3 as 
the database engine. 

We conduct three main 
comparison of the approaches over our two use cases. The first one 
compares the five approaches with each other (\secref{exp-gen}). The second one
investigates the effect of number of (unique) variants on the approaches (\secref{exp-vars}). 
The last one investigates the effect filtering out
tuples with unsatisfiable presence conditions (\secref{exp-tuples}).
