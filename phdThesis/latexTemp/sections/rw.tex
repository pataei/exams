\chapter{Related Work}
\label{ch:rw}


We have succeeded in providing a variational database framework and system by 
introducing a variation space for a database and explicitly accounting for variation in 
the database and the query language while relying on traditional non-variational RDBMSs.
To the best of our knowledge, VDB and VDBMS are the first database framework and
system that provide a generic solution to the problem of variation in databases. 
%
However, lots of work has proposed frameworks and tools to address specific kinds of
variation. In this chapter, we study some of these tools and situate the variational 
database framework in the larger research context. 
%
In \secref{vardbinstance}, we discuss multiple tools that address different kinds
of variation in databases.
%
In \secref{varsoft}, we discuss tools that address the rise of variation in
databases as a direct consequent of software development.
%
Finally, in \secref{varresearch}, we discuss some of the work on variational research.
