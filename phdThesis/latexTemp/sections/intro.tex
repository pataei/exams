Managing variation in databases is a perennial problem in database literature
and appears in different forms and 
contexts~\cite{curateVdata,ALW21vamos,ready17cidr,clams16sigmod,datahub15cidr}
and it is unavoidable~\cite{dbDecay16Stonebraker}.
%
Variation in databases mainly arises when multiple database instances 
conceptually represent the same database but differ
in their schema, content, or constraints.
%
Specific kinds of variation in databases have been addressed by 
context-specific solutions, such as
%Existing work on variation in databases addresses specific  kinds of 
%variation in a context and proposes solutions specific to the context of the
%variation, such as  
schema evolution~\cite{SchEvolRA90McKenzie, 
schVersioning97Castro, tempSchEvol91Ariav, tsql95Snodgrass, 
prima08Moon}, 
data integration~\cite{dataIntegBook}, 
and database versioning~\cite{datasetVersioning,dbVersioning}.
%
However, there are no generic solution that addresses all kind of variation
in databases. We motivate the need for a generic solution to variation
in databases in \secref{mot}.
%
%These problems have a context-specific solution. However, different
%kinds of variation in databases behave differently. 
%For example, as illustrated in 
%\figref{behave}, the variation
%in schema evolution evolves linearly over time while the variation in data
%integration comes from multiple input databases creating one output database. 
%Thus, a context-specific solution for one kind of variation in databases cannot
%be used to address another kind of variation in databases. This becomes 
%problematic when different kinds of variation in databases interact, creating
%a new kind of variation in databases. 


The major contribution of this thesis is the \emph{variational database} framework,
a generic relational database framework that explicitly accounts for database variation,
and \emph{variational relational algebra}, a query language for our framework
that allows for information extraction from a variational database. 
The framework is generic because it can encode any kind of variation
in databases. Additionally and more importantly, it is designed such that it can satisfy
any information need that a user may have in a variational database scenario. 
Based on information needs in a variational database scenario, we define 
requirements of a variational database framework in \secref{mot} and throughout the
thesis, we show that our framework satisfies these requirements.

In addition to a formal description of the variational database framework and
variational relational algebra and some theoretical results,
this thesis distributes and presents two variational data sets (including both a variational
database and a set of queries) as well as a \emph{variational database management system}
that implements the variational database framework as an abstraction layer on top of a 
traditional relational database management system in Haskell.
\secref{contribution} enumerates the specific contributions in the contest of an outline
of the structure of the rest of the thesis.
