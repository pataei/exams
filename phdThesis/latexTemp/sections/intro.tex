\TODO{points: 
- def variation in db and is everywhere
- instances but context specific solution don't suffice
- thus a generic framework that addresses problems}

\TODO{
- dimension, behaviour
- instances but context specific solution don't suffice
- example of instances
  - well-studied: schema evolution
  - partial: SPL
  - new instance either out of combination of other or new
- generic framework to instantiate for each instance and address all variational needs.}

I think this revision looks great. My only minor suggestion is to change the sentence about the case studies to something like "It presents two use cases of the variational database framework that are based on existing data sets and scenarios that are not well supported by existing techniques". Basically, make it clear that the use cases are based on prior work and that they demonstrate how we can solve problems that are not well supported otherwise.
