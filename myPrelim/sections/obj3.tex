\subsection{Demonstrate how the proposed system can be used to manage
variation in databases in different application domains}
\label{sec:ro3}

\TODO{add rq of how efficient it is compared to current.}

Having a variational database framework, we need to examine how effectively
it represents instances of variation in databases in different application domains.
Objective 3 focuses on this goal and \tabref{ro3} represents individual research 
question we need to answer for this objective.

What are the steps to generate a VDB from a scenario of variation in a database? (\vamos)

in databases as opposed to having scenario-tailored approaches? (\vamos)
