%\point{impl in haskell on top of any dbms using haskell's type class.}
%To interact with VDBs using v-queries, we implement 
%\emph{Variational Database Management System (VDBMS)}.
%VDBMS is implemented in Haskell. VDBMS sit on 
%top of any DBMS that the user desires and used to store their data 
%%\arashComment{I did not find any explanation on how v-tables are stored in an RDBMS.} 
%%\resp{it is exactly implemented as formalized in v-table section.}
%%\responded
%in form of v-tables, explained in \secref{vtab}.
%%To acquire an extensible system we implement 
%To support running VDBMS with multiple different plain relational DBMS backends,
%we provide
%a shared interface
%for connecting to and inquiring information from a DBMS and
%instantiate it for different database engines such as PostgreSQL and
%MySQL. 
%%\rewrite{any dbms that has a library in haskell that has a function
%%that returns the result to the user. eg that doesn't satisfy this is 
%%database.sqlite3. } --> The following addresses this:
%An expert can extend VDBMS to another database engine by
%writing methods for connecting to and querying from the database.
