\subsection{Stretch goal: Generalize the encoding of variation to make the framework
customizable for different application domains}
\label{sec:ro5}

The main goal of this research is to add variation as a first-class citizen to 
databases to separate the concern of dealing with variation from the application
domain, however, as discussed in \secref{ro3} there is a trade-off between 
 expressiveness and complexity. In other words, although VDB allows 
one to encode different kinds of variation it introduces more complexity than a
specialized system that only manages a specific instance of variation
since it is not bind to the application domain. 
A possible workaround this problem is to generalize the encoding of
variation to allow developers to customize variation to their use case such 
that it straps away unneeded complexity from the query language. We will 
explore this idea once objective 4 is completed and if time permits.
