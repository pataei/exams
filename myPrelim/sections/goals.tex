\section{Research Goals and Methods}
\label{sec:goals}

\subsection{Identify the kinds of variation existing in relational databases in 
different application domains}
\label{sec:ro1}

\subsection{Design a query language and implement a database management 
system that accommodate at least a subset of identified types of variations}
\label{sec:ro2}

\subsection{Mechanize proofs of properties of the language and the system}
\label{sec:ro3}

\subsection{Demonstrate how the proposed system can be used to manage
variation in databases in different application domains}
\label{sec:ro4}

%\subsection{Generalize the encoding of variation and the design of the query 
%language to cover more kinds of variation}
%\label{sec:ro5}
