\section{Statement of Thesis}
\label{sec:stmt}
The goal of this research is to provide a query language(s) and a database management 
system that explicitly account for different kinds of variation in relational databases to relieve 
some of programmer/DBA's labor by providing some guarantees within the query 
language that accounts explicitly for variation.
