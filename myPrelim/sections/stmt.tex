\section{Statement of Thesis}
\label{sec:stmt}
The goal of this research is to provide the theory and implementation fo variational databases.
The theory should define the database and the query language, including its type system and semantics.
The implementation should be aligned with the semantics of the query language.
%relieve 
%some of programmer/DBA's labor and allow them to prove properties about the encoded 
%variation.
%a framework that considers \emph{variation}
%an orthogonal concern to databases. The framework should provide the theory for such 
%a database and an accompanying query language to allow type-safe interaction with the database
%in addition to 
%a database management system that employs the theory into practice.
%
% query language(s) and a database management 
%system that explicitly account for different kinds of variation in relational databases 
%Such database management system is expected to relieve 
%some of programmer/DBA's labor and allow them to prove properties about the encoded 
%variation.
%  providing some guarantees with regards to
%
%within the query 
%language that accounts explicitly for variation.
