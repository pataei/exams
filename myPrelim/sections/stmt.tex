\section{Statement of Thesis}
\label{sec:stmt}
The goal of this research is to provide a framework that considers \emph{variation}
an orthogonal concern to databases. The framework should provide the theory for such 
a database and an accompanying query language to allow type-safe interaction with the database
in addition to 
a database management system that employs the theory into practice.
%
% query language(s) and a database management 
%system that explicitly account for different kinds of variation in relational databases 
Such database management system is expected to relieve 
some of programmer/DBA's labor and allow them to prove properties about the encoded 
variation.
%  providing some guarantees with regards to
%
%within the query 
%language that accounts explicitly for variation.
