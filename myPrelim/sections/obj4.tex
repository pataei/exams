\subsection{Mechanize proofs of properties of the language and the system}
\label{sec:ro4}

Having established that our framework  effectively and explicitly encode variation 
within the database and its query language, we need to ensure that it satisfies
the properties we desire. Objective 4 aims to define such properties and
prove that they hold for our framework. 
%Additionally, it aims to prove that
%VDBMS implements the semantics of VRA correctly. 
\tabref{ro4} presents
individual research questions we need to answer for this objective.
