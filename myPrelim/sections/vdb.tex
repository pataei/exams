\subsubsection{Variational Database}
\label{sec:vdb}

%\point{introduce vdb and its parts.}
%A \emph{Variational Database (VDB)} is intuitively meaningful when a set of database 
%instances with variations in the schema and/or content exists and a user's information
%need requires accessing some or all of them simultaneously. 
To incorporate variability within a database, we annotate elements with feature expressions,
as introduced in \secref{encode-var}. We use annotated elements both in the schema and content.
Within a schema we allow attributes and relations to exist 
conditionally based on the feature expression assigned to them (\secref{vsch}).
At the content level, we annotate each tuple with a feature expression, indicating when the tuple 
is present (\secref{vtab}).

%\eric{could you pls review this?}
%Consequently, the existence of parts of a VDB is variational (conditional). 
%This condition potentially changes by running queries, explicated in \secref{vrel-alg}.
%It is captured by a feature expression, called \emph{variational context} and 
%denoted by \vctx. 
%In our definitions of VDB parts, we discuss the condition under which the part is
%valid and present. The condition holds when a feature expression, \dimMeta,
%is satisfiable.
%Such a condition is always considered under the variational context of VDB
%at the moment. To apply this restriction, we conjunct the variational context with
%\dimMeta. Hence, the condition is the satisfiability of $\dimMeta \wedge \vctx$.
%For brevity, we do not explain this over and over again. Rather,
%we specify it in the condition for validity of an element.
