\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


With this initial ..., we propose the following research:

\begin{itemize}
\item Objective 1: Identify the kinds of variation existing in relational databases in 
different application domains.
\item Objective 2: Design a query language and implement a database management 
system that accommodate at least a subset of types of variations identified in objective 1.
\item Objective 3: Mechanize proofs of properties of the language and the system.
\item Objective 4: Demonstrate how the proposed system can be used to manage
variation in databases in different application domains.
%\item Objective 5: Generalize the encoding of variation and the design of the query 
%language to cover more kinds of variation.
\end{itemize}
